<p>Here&rsquo;s some information about all the ways you can enjoy MUSICMATCH. </p>

not transfer copies of cached content to any other device via any means. By using the Mobile Service, you agree to accept
the Mobile Terms and to register for the Service as a mobile subscriber. The Premium Service and the Unlimited Service
are hereinafter referred to as “Paid Subscriptions”.</p>

<h3><a name="s3-2"></a>3.2 Codes and other Limited Offers</h3>

<p>If you have purchased a code sold by or on behalf of MUSICMATCH for access to the Unlimited Service or Premium Service
for the time period indicated on your email, card or paper receipt (&ldquo;Code&rdquo;), or if you are accessing the service
through some other limited offer which you received or purchased from MUSICMATCH (&ldquo;Limited Offer&rdquo;), these

for a Trial, and to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability.</p>

<p>For some Trials, we&rsquo;ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. At the end of such
Trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the Premium Service on the first day following the end of the Trial,

you have the right to change your mind and receive a full refund within fourteen (14) days of purchase (the &ldquo;Cooling-off
Period&rdquo;), but only if you have not logged in or otherwise redeemed or started to consume them.</p>

<p>If you have a Paid Subscription, your payment to MUSICMATCH will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period,
unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page
before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current
subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service. However, if you cancel your payment and/or terminate
the Terms after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), and/or before the end of the subscription period, we
will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.</p>

<p>MUSICMATCH may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions from time
to time, and will communicate any price changes to you. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start

your access to the MUSICMATCH Service, you agree that MUSICMATCH shall have no liability or responsibility to you and MUSICMATCH
will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. To learn
how to terminate your MUSICMATCH account, please contact us through the Customer Service contact form.</p>

<h2><a name="s14">14.</a> Warranty</h2>

<p>We endeavor to provide the best service we can, but you understand and agree that THE MUSICMATCH SERVICE IS PROVIDED
&ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. YOU USE THE MUSICMATCH SERVICE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.  MUSICMATCH DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
In addition, MUSICMATCH does not warrant, endorse, guarantee or assume responsibility for any Third Party Applications,
Third Party Application content, User Content, or any other product or service advertised or offered by a third party on
or through the MUSICMATCH Service or any hyperlinked website, or featured in any banner or other advertising.  You understand
and agree that MUSICMATCH is not responsible or liable for any transaction between you and third-party providers of Third
Party Applications or products or services advertised on or through the MUSICMATCH Service. As with any purchase of a product
or service through any medium or in any environment, you should use your judgment and exercise caution where appropriate.
No advice or information whether oral or in writing obtained by you from MUSICMATCH shall create any warranty on behalf of
MUSICMATCH in this regard.  Some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions.</p>

<h2><a name="s15">15.</a> Limitation</h2>

<p>You agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, your sole and exclusive remedy for any problems or dissatisfaction
with the MUSICMATCH Service, the Third Party Applications or the Third Party Application content is to uninstall any MUSICMATCH software
and to stop using the MUSICMATCH Service, the Third Party Applications or the Third Party Application content.</p>

<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL MUSICMATCH, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (i) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE MUSICMATCH SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT, REGARDLESS
OF LEGAL THEORY, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER MUSICMATCH HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A
REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (ii) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE MUSICMATCH SERVICE, THIRD PARTY
APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT MORE THAN THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO MUSICMATCH DURING THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS IN QUESTION. </p>

<p>Nothing in these Agreements removes or limits MUSICMATCH&rsquo;s liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or
personal injury caused by its negligence. Some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions.</p>

<h2><a name="s16">16.</a> Entire agreement</h2>

<p>These Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and MUSICMATCH and supersede any prior
agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral. Any additional or different
terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter of the Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to
MUSICMATCH are void. You represent that you have not accepted the Agreements in reliance on any oral or written representations
made by MUSICMATCH that are not contained in the Agreements.</p>

<p>Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the MUSICMATCH Service may be governed by additional agreements.
That could include, for example, access to the MUSICMATCH Community for customer support, access to the MUSICMATCH Service as
a result of a gift card, or free or discounted Trials.  You will agree to separate terms and conditions in those circumstances,
which are listed in full <a href="/se/legal/links/">here</a>. Those terms and conditions shall
govern only with regard to the aspect of the Service to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these
Agreements, and do not supersede these Agreements.  To the extent that there is any conflict between those agreements and
these Agreements, these Agreements shall control, except as otherwise provided in these Terms </p>

<p>Occasionally we may offer you the chance to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys (&ldquo;Special
Promotions&rdquo;) through the Service. Special Promotions may be governed by terms and conditions that are separate
from these Terms. If the provisions of a Special Promotion&rsquo;s terms and conditions conflict with these Terms, those
separate terms and conditions shall prevail.</p>

<h2><a name="s17">17.</a> Severability</h2>

<p>Should any provision of the Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or
enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Terms,
and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2><a name="s18">18.</a> Choice of law, mandatory arbitration and venue</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, these
Agreements are subject to the laws of Sweden, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.  Further, you and
MUSICMATCH agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy that
arises in connection with these Agreements.</p>

<p>If you are a United States user, the following mandatory arbitration provisions also apply to you:

<p>
  <ol class="roman-list">
    <li>You and MUSICMATCH agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the MUSICMATCH
    Service or your use thereof, including our Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree
    that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and
    MUSICMATCH are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action.
    This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Agreements and the termination of your MUSICMATCH account.
    The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
    Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;), as modified by these Agreements,
    and as administered by the AAA. You and MUSICMATCH agree that these Agreements involve interstate commerce and are subject
    to the Federal Arbitration Act.</li>
    <li>You and MUSICMATCH agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine the validity or ownership of
    any intellectual property rights, and (b) any claims related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use of
    the MUSICMATCH Service are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and MUSICMATCH agree that these claims
    (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable relief) shall be exclusively decided by courts of
    competent jurisdiction in San Francisco County, California or New York, New York, and that applicable California
    and/or Federal law shall govern, without regard to choice of law principles.</li>
    <li>YOU AND MUSICMATCH AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
    NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, no arbitrator shall consolidate any
    other person&rsquo;s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class
    proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration
    section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.</li>
    <li>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the
    date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise
    to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If
    applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the
    shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will
    be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by MUSICMATCH. Any arbitration
    costs or fees deemed &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; will be paid by MUSICMATCH.</li>
